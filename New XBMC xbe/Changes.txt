1) Changed how the login screen works when launching a profile for the first time. It no longer asks to edit the info.
2) Removed some of the functionality from the profile settings dialog. ALso copies the guisettings & sources automatically.
3) Changed how the game save menu works, it now doesn't list "TitleMeta.xbx" files as files, there in the own directory like the rest.
4) Increased the Splash screen display time, no point having a nice splash if you dont get to see it.
5) Fullscreen Splashscreen!
6) Faster loading of your games library. ( disables the directory check/scan when entering the games menu )
7) Added my Synopsis script to the context menu for the MyPrograms windows
8) Added a new custom window _script*.xml will now be automatically parsed like Custom*.xml
9) Added the option to disable the splash image via the advancedsettings.xml ( <splash>false</splash> )
10) nosplash.bin added to the root folder to easily disable the splash if you don't want to use the advancedsettings.xml
11) Splash overlay file so folk can keep the splash but add there own logo or visa-versa. ( splash_overlay.png )
12) Fix ported over from Kodi to fix the SetFocus function, it now focuses from the first entry in the list instead of the current page.
13) Updated the debug overlay to use debugloggin font name and added MBs to the layout.
14) Fixed centering labels in lists.
( If you have a skin that uses center for its labels in a list you may want to remove the offset you had to use for posx )
15) Update to the center label fix in lists, if your skin version is 2.1 it will use the old way and if its 2.2 or higher will use the fixed way.
16) Fixed the XBE title extraction from the xbe files, so no more broken names!
