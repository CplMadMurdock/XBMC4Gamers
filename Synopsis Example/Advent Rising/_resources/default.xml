	<overview>In Advent Rising, a common legend pervades the galaxy--that one day humans will deliver the universe. Many view humans as the messiah, a symbol of hope, or fantastical creatures, but the Seekers view them as enemies that must be destroyed. In third- and first-person points of view, you'll realize what it means to be truly human as you delve into an intergalactic saga. Advent Rising sets you on an action-packed adventure where you'll develop superhuman powers, wield an arsenal of high-tech weapons, and command a vast array of futuristic vehicles.</overview>
